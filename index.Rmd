# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online resource is a compilation of exercises created for a graduate level course in Genomic Data Analysis at the University of Arkansas, taught by [Dr. Jeffrey Lewis](thelewislab.com). The exercises included have been developed by graduate student [Carson Stacy](clstacy.github.io) in collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Lewis.

## Usage

Each chapter corresponds to a class exercise, most of which are completed in R. There are .Rmd files available for each of the chapters available [here](https://github.com/clstacy/GenomicDataAnalysis_Fa23/tree/main/exercises), where you can complete the exercises yourself.

## **Key Features**

-   **Real Genomic Datasets:** Explore exercises using genuine genomic datasets. This hands-on experience allows users to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, mirroring the challenges encountered in real-world genomics research.

-   **Focus on Biological Context:** Beyond coding, the exercises emphasize the biological questions addressed by genomic data analysis. Understanding the context behind the code is crucial for meaningful interpretation of results in genomics research.
